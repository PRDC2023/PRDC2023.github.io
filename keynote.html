    <center><strong><font size="+2">Rethinking Software Fault Tolerance</font></strong></center>
    
    <p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		Complex systems in different domains contain significant amount of software. Several studies have established that a large fraction of system outages are due to software faults. Traditional methods of fault avoidance, fault removal based on extensive testing/debugging, and fault tolerance based on design/data diversity are found inadequate to ensure high software dependability. The key challenge then is how to provide highly dependable software. We discuss a viewpoint of fault tolerance of software-based systems to ensure high dependability. We classify software faults into Bohrbugs and Mandelbugs, and identify aging-related bugs as a subtype of the latter. Traditional methods have been designed to deal with Bohrbugs. The key challenge then is to develop mitigation methods for Mandelbugs in general and aging-related bugs in particular. We submit that mitigation methods for Mandelbugs utilize environmental diversity. Retry operation, restart application, failover to an identical replica (hot, warm or cold) and reboot the OS are reactive recovery techniques applied after the occurrence of a failure. They are examples of techniques that rely on environmental diversity. For software aging related bugs, it is also possible to utilize a proactive environmental diversity technique known as software rejuvenation. We discuss environmental diversity both from experimental and analytic points of view and cite examples of real systems employing these techniques.

	<center><strong><font size="+2">Cyber Resilience explained through a Blockchain example</font></strong></center>
	
	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		Resilient computing is attracting attention as an emerging paradigm, driven by the shortcomings of cybersecurity techniques in face of the current challenges to IT systems. These classic paradigms are largely based on prevention and reaction, assuming static or pre-defined architecture configurations, number of participants, system and threat/fault assumptions, or unconditional trust in stakeholders/third parties. I will briefly introduce this status quo, motivating the need for cyber resilience further to cyber security. 
To make matters concrete about the mindset behind resilient computing, the bulk of the talk will discuss the challenges faced when you go about conceiving a distributed fault/intrusion tolerant and resilient system … that ends-up implementing a Blockchain. More exactly, a high-speed permissionless blockchain system secure against attackers with way more than 51% network computing power, and resilient to all attacks known at date of publication (RepuCoin, for those interested to have a sneak-peek).

		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		The key mission of computer science is to help people construct
reliable, performant, and usable software. To this end, there have
been substantial conceptual, technological, and practical advances for
engineering high-quality software---we have better processes,
languages, compilers, and development tools. On the other hand, the
fundamental processes and toolchains are not significantly different
from those in the early days of the field. In this talk, I will share
some reflections on how we may advance the science and practice of
engineering software. The talk highlights several areas and directions
that I believe are critical and offer promising opportunities for
significantly moving our field forward.

	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		As an example of exploiting the synergy between AI and software engineering, the field of intelligent software engineering (denoting intelligent [software engineering] or AI for software engineering) has emerged with various advances in recent years. This field focuses on instilling intelligence in approaches developed to address various software engineering tasks to accomplish high effectiveness and efficiency, including but not limited to accomplishing the goal of high software dependability. This talk will discuss recent research and future directions in the field of intelligent software engineering for accomplishing the goal of high software dependability, while attempting to explore “how far can we go” with intelligent solutions.

		<strong>Title</strong>
		Secure Network Measurement as a Cloud Service
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		Network function virtualisation enables versatile network functions as cloud services. Specifically, network measurement tasks such as heavy-hitter detection and flow distribution estimation serve many core network functions for improved performance and security of enterprise networks. However, deploying network measurement services in third-party cloud providers raises privacy and security concerns. In this talk, I will present the design of our recent work named OblivSketch - a secure network measurement service built from Intel SGX. We harness the insights from confidential computing, large-scale network flow analysis, and data-oblivious primitives to build a secure and practical network measurement service. We integrate OblivSketch into the framework of SDN and demonstrate its performance via CAIDA datasets with millions of flows.

		<strong>Title</strong>
		Dependability and Fault-Tolerance of Cooperative Mobile Robots: The Gap Between Theory and Pragmatism
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Speaker</strong>
		Xavier Défago (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan)
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		From an abstract viewpoint, groups/fleets/swarms of mobile robots can be seen as an extended form of distributed system where nodes are mobile and where they can interact through their actions on the environment. Due to demographic pressure on many world economies, robot and device coordination is bound to become gradually more prevalent in infrastructure-like systems over the next decades. As a result, it is becoming increasingly more important to ensure the dependability of such systems.
		In this talk, I will highlight the gap between theory and practice of fault-tolerance cooperative mobile robot systems. The first part of the talk will overview important theoretical results in cooperative mobile robotics and on self-stabilization. The second part will discuss multi-agent systems problems such as pickup and delivery and iterative multi-agent path finding. The third part will briefly discuss about Byzantine fault-tolerance in actual robot systems.

	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Abstract</strong>
		Nowadays, holistic approach toward safety is demanded worldwide. In this panel session, the panelists introduce the concepts of Safety 2.0 which is newly proposed and including concept of collaborative safety in addition to the conventional functional safety.  Furthermore, the panelists discuss on how the safety (including ANSHIN and health) which leads to our wellbeing should be, and how should we realize it.
